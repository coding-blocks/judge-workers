## Workers

Workers are docker containers that run the code. They have simple requirements

 - They have one compile.sh file that compiles (if required) the source
 - They have a run.sh file that runs the source or the binary

## Composition

All workers are built on top of [alpine linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) 3.6

## Supported Languages

Currently, we have following images -

 - [c](containers/c)
 - [cpp](containers/cpp)
 - [c#](containers/csharp)
 - [golang](containers/golang)
